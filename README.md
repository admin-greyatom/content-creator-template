# Content Creation for GreyAtom

Hi! Thank you for expressing your interest to create content for GreyAtom. This repository contains two folders:
- linear-regression: This folder contains an end to end concept created for GreyAtom and deployed in GLabs - our in-house learning platform.
- template-notebook: This folder is the template that the content creator must use to create their content. For the optimum learning experience for our global learners, we mandate that this template be used. 

The advanced specialization programs that are currently being built for our global learners are 
- [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://trello.com/b/fcjVfzD4/nlp-with-deep-learning)
- [Computer Vision with Deep Learning](https://trello.com/b/onCcECs0/computer-vision-with-deep-learning)

If interested to contribute to content creation or mentoring, please fill the form [Join As a Global Mentor](https://goo.gl/forms/Ft1jY1B4I9MsFQQ62). If you have already filled the form, please ignore.
